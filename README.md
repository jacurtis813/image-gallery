## Breakdown/ What we are doing?

1. Create all files needed to begin creating the challenge for this course content
2. After creating the files needed and locating the content to fill the image gallery challenge
3. Copy the link and script tags/ elements to locate the content from within bootstrap
4. Create our own link to perform our own styling
5. Image content that we are using is from a website called unsplash
6. Create the first class from the bootstrap cdn within the div container, createing the jumbotron
7. Use bootstrap to further style the jumbotron, place within the class of container, this applying the border-radius property and margin to the jumbotron
8. Create the navbar for the image gallery, start with copying the content for the navbar from a previous navbar that we created
9. Edit the opening tab name in the navbar to read images rather than the previous text
10. Test and run the code that we have used to build our navbar, remember that this is why it is beneficial to using bootstrap, large pieces of content all at once
11. Understanding how to change the color of the jumbotron simply by changing the name to edit the background color
12. Create the comments for the HTML to keep the file clean and concise to read and write

17. Now we will begin to format the code at the medium breakpoint within our page, using bootstrap
18. Format the breakpoints using the bootstrap column class names to break the page down cleanly
19. Now we will create the icon for hero/ jumbotron- using bootstrap
20. Learn how to create the icons for both the hero and the nav bar icon
21. Learn how to use the padding and margin property for the nav bar with another class that is set in the framework
22. Use these classes to set the nave bar flush with the hero buttoned up to it
23. Test and run all the new code that we have now formatted within these files, one small issue with the padding on the top of the hero
